In this post, we pull back the curtain on this new NXOS EVPN Hybrid mode and understand how it enables interoperability with Asymmetric VTEPs.
<!--more-->

## tl;dr

Cisco gave this a fancy name - EVPN Hybrid mode. Or you know, maybe just call it Asymmetric IRB? Because that's what it is behind the scenes.

## Topology

## Understanding why Asymmetric IRB does not work on NXOS

For this, let's consider communication between h1 and h4. We'll configure leaf1 and leaf3 for Asymmetric IRB - this implies that all VLANs, VNIs and IRB interfaces exist on both leafs. In our case, this means VLAN 100, VNI 10100, VLAN 200, VNI 10200 and its respective IRB interfaces are configured on both leaf1 and leaf3. 

### Configuration

For leaf1, which is running NXOS, the relevant configuration is as follows:

```
nv overlay evpn

    rd 192.0.2.1:200
    route-target import 200:200
    route-target export 200:200
```

On leaf3, which is running Junos OS, we create routing-instances of type mac-vrf - one routing-instance per VLAN since we're enabling it for VLAN-based service type. 

```

    }
}
```

Since each leaf is configured with all IRBs, every VLAN is essentially directly connected to each leaf. This implies that both leaf1 and leaf3 can directly ARP for any host on VLAN100 or VLAN200.

### Packet walk to visualize the problem

h1 has 10.100.100.254 as its default gateway. When pinging h4, it knows that the destination is in a different subnet and it needs to send the packet to its default gateway. ARP process provides the IP-MAC binding for 10.100.100.254 and h1 sends the ICMP request to leaf1.

On leaf1, since the destination MAC address is owned by it, a route lookup is done for 10.100.200.4. This hits the directly connected subnet route:

```
leaf1# show ip route 10.100.200.4
IP Route Table for VRF "default"
'*' denotes best ucast next-hop
'**' denotes best mcast next-hop
'[x/y]' denotes [preference/metric]
'%<string>' in via output denotes VRF <string>

10.100.200.0/24, ubest/mbest: 1/0, attached
    *via 10.100.200.254, Vlan200, [0/0], 00:29:41, direct
```

leaf1 can now ARP for the destination directly. Since this fabric is configured for Ingress Replication (default on Junos OS is Ingress Replication and we have explictly configured Ingress Replication on NXOS), leaf1 uses its flood list for VLAN 200 to package the broadcast ARP into a unicast VXLAN packet and send it to every VTEP (PE) in the flood list. This includes leaf3.

When leaf3 receives this, it decapsulates the VXLAN packet and floods the ARP to all local ports in VLAN 200. h4 now receives this ARP packet, it builds its local ARP cache and sends an ARP reply back.

Let's take a look at this ARP reply:

![arp_reply_h4](/images/multivendor/nxos_evpn_hybrid_mode/arp_reply_h4.jpg)

Seems like an ordinary ARP reply, but carefully observe the destination MAC address in the Ethernet header. This is the anycast gateway MAC address. When this ARP reply reaches leaf3, it will consume this packet since it owns the anycast MAC address and leaf1 will never see this ARP reply. Because of this, the ARP entry for 10.100.200.4 will always remain incomplete, and leaf1 has no knowledge of how to forward traffic to this destination.

```

For Asymmetric IRB to work, the VTEP must build its ARP table from EVPN Type-2 MAC+IP routes. Without this functionality, Asymmetric IRB will fail, as we can clearly see. And it appears that NXOS does not do this, which is why it does not support Asymmetric IRB.

The following packet walk provides an easy to understand visual representation of the failure:

![packetwalk](/images/multivendor/nxos_evpn_hybrid_mode/packetwalk.jpg)

## Enabling Symmetric IRB between NXOS leafs

Before we look at how EVPN Hybrid mode works, let's first consider Symmetric IRB between leaf1 and leaf2 (both NXOS). The goal is to get h1 to talk to h2 (communication between VLAN 100 and VLAN 200). On the NXOS leafs, Symmetric IRB requires the following sample configuration (consider leaf1 as an example). First, a VLAN is created and the L3VNI is mapped it. This VNI is configured for the customer VRF, which call 'Tenant1' here:

```
vlan 300
  vn-segment 10300
!
vrf context Tenant1
  vni 10300
  rd auto
  address-family ipv4 unicast
    route-target import 65421:300
    route-target import 65421:300 evpn
    route-target export 65421:300
    route-target export 65421:300 evpn
```

An anycast MAC address is configured on all the leafs (using '*fabric forwarding anycast-gateway-mac*'), and the IRB interfaces are enabled with '*fabric forwarding mode anycast-gateway*'. This enables the anycast gateway functionality on the IRB interface. Each leaf is also configured for it's respective VLAN/BD under EVPN along with the import/export route-targets (these are the MAC VRF route-targets for the L2 domain).

You also need to create an IRB interface for the VLAN mapped to the L3VNI and it is configured to be in the customer VRF.

```
fabric forwarding anycast-gateway-mac 000a.000a.000a
!
interface Vlan100
  no shutdown
  vrf member Tenant1
  ip address 10.100.100.254/24
  fabric forwarding mode anycast-gateway
!
interface Vlan300
  no shutdown
  vrf member Tenant1
  ip forward
```

The L3VNI is enabled under the NVE interface:

```
interface nve1
  no shutdown
  host-reachability protocol bgp
  advertise virtual-rmac
  source-interface loopback0
  member vni 10100
    ingress-replication protocol bgp
  member vni 10300 associate-vrf
```

By default, NXOS does not advertise an EVPN Type-5 subnet route (we'll talk about the need for this route at a later point in this blog post). This is done using the 'redistribute direct ...' configuration under the VRF IPv4 unicast address family under BGP:

```
router bgp 65421
  router-id 192.0.2.1
  log-neighbor-changes
  address-family ipv4 unicast
    redistribute direct route-map allow-loopback
    maximum-paths 4
  address-family l2vpn evpn
    advertise-pip
  template peer evpn
    update-source loopback0
    ebgp-multihop 2
    address-family l2vpn evpn
      send-community
      send-community extended
  neighbor 192.0.2.11
    inherit peer evpn
    remote-as 65500
  neighbor 192.0.2.22
    inherit peer evpn
    remote-as 65500
  neighbor 198.51.100.1
    remote-as 65500
    address-family ipv4 unicast
  neighbor 198.51.100.9
    remote-as 65500
    address-family ipv4 unicast
  vrf Tenant1
    address-family ipv4 unicast
      redistribute direct route-map permit-all
```

Leaf1 learns h1s MAC address and IPv4 address using ARP/ND. We can initiate a ping from h1 (to its default gateway, 10.100.100.254, which is present on leaf1) to trigger this process.

```
root@h1:~# ping 10.100.100.254
PING 10.100.100.254 (10.100.100.254) 56(84) bytes of data.

4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 6ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.856/2.599/4.431/1.064 ms
```

Within the VRF, an ARP entry is created for h1 and this is pushed to BGP EVPN as well. This gets advertised as an EVPN Type-2 MAC+IP route to the spines, and from there to leaf2.

```
leaf1# show ip arp vrf Tenant1

The extended communities added to this are important - you see both the L2 route-targets as well as the L3VNI route-target, along with the router MAC address. This router MAC address corresponds to IRB interface MAC address while the L3VNI route-target is used to identify (and import into) the customer VRF:

```

In addition to the host route, an EVPN Type-5 route (for the IRB subnet) is also advertised in accordance to the RFC (RFC 9135) for silent hosts (to trigger the gleaning process for such hosts). This subnet route is pulled into the VRF as well:

h1 should now be able to ping h2 and a data-plane captures shows that the VNI in the VXLAN header is the L3VNI:

## Configuring leaf3 for Asymmetric IRB

Let's configure leaf3 now for Asymmetric IRB. This implies that the IRB interface for both VLAN100 and VLAN200 exist on leaf3, along with their corresponding L2VNIs. Routing-instances are created for both VLAN100 and VLAN200 with service-type VLAN-based.

## Why Symmetric IRB on one leaf and Asymmetric IRB on another leaf does not work

Our primary test is to check connectivity between h2 and h3 (since they are in different subnets - h2 is in VLAN200 and h3 is in VLAN100).

h3 can ping its default gateway (10.100.100.254, which exists on leaf3 since it is an anycast gateway):

```
root@h3:~# ping 10.100.100.254
PING 10.100.100.254 (10.100.100.254) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.100.100.254: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=119 ms
64 bytes from 10.100.100.254: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=114 ms
64 bytes from 10.100.100.254: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=128 ms
64 bytes from 10.100.100.254: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=149 ms
^C
--- 10.100.100.254 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 6ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 113.884/127.348/149.132/13.538 ms
```

Naturally, h3 cannot ping h2:

```
root@h3:~# ping 10.100.200.2
PING 10.100.200.2 (10.100.200.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
^C
--- 10.100.200.2 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 90ms
```

This fails because while leaf3 has the required information for h2 (it has an IRB interface for VLAN200 and is thus able to ARP for h2 directly), leaf2 does not have any information about h3 in its forwarding table. It is receiving the EVPN Type-2 MAC+IP route but it does not know what to do with it since there is no corresponding L2VNI (more importantly, no matching import route-target). It simply drops the prefix, as seen below:

```

## Enabling EVPN Hybrid mode on NXOS 

This is where EVPN Hybrid mode comes in. Cisco is purposefully very vague about how this really works, but we're going to break it down. From their documentation (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/nx-os/nexus9000/102x/configuration/vxlan/cisco-nexus-9000-series-nx-os-vxlan-configuration-guide-release-102x/m-evpn-hybrid-irb-mode.html), the most important pieces of information are:


>NX-OS symmetric IRB VTEPs must be provisioned with all subnets in an IP VRF that are stretched to asymmetric VTEPs in the fabric.
>NX-OS symmetric IRB VTEPs must be provisioned with subnets in an IP VRF that are stretched to asymmetric VTEPs in “hybrid” mode using “fabric forwarding mode anycast-gateway hybrid” CLI under the subnet SVI interface.
>All symmetric IRB VTEPs must have the hybrid mode enabled when interoperating with asymmetric VTEPs in each fabric.

So, you're really configuring the device for Asymmetric IRB, but with the continued existence of the IP VRF and the corresponding L3VNI. This is the additional configuration that we're going to add on leaf2 now:

```
vlan 100
  vn-segment 10100

interface Vlan100
  no shutdown
  vrf member Tenant1
  ip address 10.100.100.254/24

    route-target import 200:200
    route-target export 200:200
```

This is installed into the MAC address table:

```
leaf2# show mac address-table address aac1.abc1.c674
Legend: 
        * - primary entry, G - Gateway MAC, (R) - Routed MAC, O - Overlay MAC
        age - seconds since last seen,+ - primary entry using vPC Peer-Link,
        (T) - True, (F) - False, C - ControlPlane MAC, ~ - vsan,

```

So basically, with all of this new configuration, we have configured leaf2 for Asymmetric IRB (only for destinations behind leafs doing Asymmetric IRB). However, remember why Asymmetric IRB did not work in the first place on NXOS? The ARP process was functionally broken. Is it fixed now? Let's take a look:

```
leaf2# show ip arp vrf Tenant1 

Flags: * - Adjacencies learnt on non-active FHRP router
       + - Adjacencies synced via CFSoE
       # - Adjacencies Throttled for Glean
       CP - Added via L2RIB, Control plane Adjacencies
       PS - Added via L2RIB, Peer Sync
       RO - Re-Originated Peer Sync Entry
       D - Static Adjacencies attached to down interface

IP ARP Table for context Tenant1
Total number of entries: 1
Address         Age       MAC Address     Interface       Flags
10.100.200.2    00:00:08  aac1.ab83.9993  Vlan200     
```

Well, that's odd. No ARP for 10.100.100.3. Clearly h3 can ping h2 now, so how is it working?

```

```

The secret lies behind the 'fabric forwarding mode anycast-gateway hybrid' command - looking at the l2route table, you can see that the 'Asymmetric' flag is set (Asy), and the IP-MAC binding is sent directly to Adjacency Manager (AM) instead of installing it in the ARP table:

```

We can confirm this from the logs below. BGP EVPN sends this to l2rib, which in turn sends it to AM.

Our final confirmation is that the entry exists in the adjacency table:

```
leaf2# show ip adjacency vrf Tenant1 

Flags: # - Adjacencies Throttled for Glean
       G - Adjacencies of vPC peer with G/W bit
       R - Adjacencies learnt remotely
       CP - Added via L2RIB, Control plane Adjacencies
       PS - Added via L2RIB, Peer Sync
       RO - Re-Originated Peer Sync Entry
       CC - Consistency check pending

IP Adjacency Table for VRF Tenant1
Total number of entries: 2

10.100.200.2    aac1.ab83.9993  50   arp        Vlan200

```

As you can see, the source for 10.100.100.3 is 'am_l2rib' and the 'CP' flag is set, which implies it was learnt via L2RIB. The question that then arises from this is that is Cisco in violation of the RFC? Must we see this entry in the ARP table? No, they are not violating the RFC and it is not necessary to see the entry in the ARP table. RFC9135 states the following:

>For IP-to-MAC bindings learned via EVPN, an implementation may choose to import these bindings directly to the respective forwarding table (such as an adjacency/next-hop table) as opposed to importing them to ARP or ND protocol tables

It's a little sneaky, and easy to miss if you don't know where to look. And perhaps the reason it is implemented this way is to ensure that Asymmetric IRB continues to be natively unsupported on NXOS, but it will work (for interoperability reasons) if you have Symmetric IRB with L3VNIs, and the IRBs are configured in this EVPN Hybrid mode.
